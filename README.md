## Hi there 👋, my name is Nayra Romero  
### and I'm a Junior Front-end Developer 💻

My passion for challenges led me to become interested in technology. This made me decide to enter the world of web development, specifically in the front-end, as it links my two passions: ✨ technology and design ✨.

I'm looking for my first professional experience as a front end developer to show what I'm capable of 🙌🏼.
